Install in editable mode:

1. Open a terminal in your project root (where pyproject.toml is located).
2. Run:
	pip install -e .
3. Now, any changes you make to files in your project will be reflected immediately when you run your code.


HOW TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB
=======================

Here’s how to upload your **p2c** project to GitHub from scratch:


**1. Create a new repository on GitHub:**

* Log into your GitHub account.
* Click the **+** icon in the top right → **New repository**.
* Name it (e.g., `p2c`).
* Choose Public if you want the module to be freely viewable, downloadable, and installable by anyone. Choose Private if you want to restrict access.
* Don’t initialize with a README, `.gitignore`, or license (you already have them locally).
* Click **Create repository**.


**2. Open a terminal in your project root** (where `pyproject.toml` is located).


**3. Initialize a Git repository locally:**
	git init


**4. Add all project files to staging:**
	git add .


**5. Commit the files:**
	git commit -m "Initial commit: p2c project"


**6. Link your local repo to the GitHub repo:**
Replace `<yourname>` with your GitHub username.
	git branch -M main
	git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourname>/p2c.git


**7. Push your local repo to GitHub:**
	git push -u origin main


**8. Verify:**

* Visit your repository URL on GitHub.
* You should see all your project files uploaded.

**Optional – running your tests locally before upload:**
	pip install pytest
	pytest -q

If all tests pass, you’ll see:
	```
	.
	1 passed in 0.02s
	```


How someone else can install your package from GitHub
=====================================================

If your repository is public, anyone can install your package directly from its GitHub URL using pip:

	pip install git+https://github.com/<yourname>/p2c.git

Replace <yourname> with your GitHub username.

This command:
  Downloads the repository from GitHub.
  Builds and installs it into their Python environment.

Editable mode from GitHub: Not directly possible; editable installs require local files. To use editable mode, they should clone the repo first:
	git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/p2c.git
	cd p2c
	pip install -e .
